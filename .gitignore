# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version
#   is managed by the end user. For a specific project, it is recommended to include them.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if you want to keep your dependencies next to your project
#   and not in the ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/ folder, you can use the PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT
#   environment variable. Then pipenv will create a .venv directory.

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
