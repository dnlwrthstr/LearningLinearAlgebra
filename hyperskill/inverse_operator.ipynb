    "3) If a linear operator $A$ is invertible, then its inverse operator is also invertible, and $(A^{-1})^{-1} = A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) A linear operator $A : V \\to V$ is invertible if and only if $\\ker A = \\{0\\}$ and $\\operatorname{Im} A = V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) If a linear operator $A : V \\to V$ is invertible and $\\dim V < \\infty$, then its inverse operator has a matrix that is the inverse of the matrix of the operator $A$ in the same basis.\n"
