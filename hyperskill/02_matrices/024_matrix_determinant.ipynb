    "- linear independence of $n$ vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\n",
    "- and the *hypervolume* formed by $n$ vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the determinant is not limited to these applications. From a theoretical point of view, it is a very special function called **multilinear**, and it has unique structural properties that you will study later. From a practical point of view, determinants appear in many different contexts, often simplifying computations and providing geometric insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most important applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Invertibility**\n",
    "  The determinant allows you to quickly determine whether a matrix is invertible. This is a fundamental property when solving systems of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**\n",
    "  Determinants play a crucial role in finding eigenvalues of a matrix. Eigenvalues are defined as solutions of an equation derived from a determinant, a topic you will explore in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Change of Basis**\n",
    "  When changing the basis of a vector space, the determinant of the change-of-basis matrix provides information about how volumes are scaled between the old basis and the new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matrix Diagonalization**\n",
    "  Diagonalization expresses a complicated matrix as a product of simpler ones, each with a clear geometric interpretation. Determinants are closely tied to when and how this is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Transformations**\n",
    "  Linear transformations preserve the structure of vector spaces. The determinant measures how such transformations distort space, for example by stretching, compressing, or reversing orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculation of Areas and Volumes**\n",
    "  Integration is a powerful tool for computing areas and volumes of complex regions. Remarkably, the evaluation of certain integrals fundamentally involves determinants, especially in change-of-variables formulas.\n",
