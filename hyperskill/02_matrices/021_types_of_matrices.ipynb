    "# Types of matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices, like any other mathematical tool, make our lives easier. Of course, they are not as simple as everyday operations such as multiplication or division, which help us calculate things like how much 2 kilograms of apples cost. Still, matrices are present all around us in many more sophisticated processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you surf the web, some data is encrypted—and for that, we need matrices. When an economist prepares a report or data is analyzed, matrices once again play a crucial role. Imagine a manager in a grocery store who wants to compare customers based on their purchases. One possible approach is to represent each receipt as a matrix, where each entry corresponds to the quantity of a particular product purchased. These matrices can then be compared and analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have seen how broadly applicable matrices are, we hope you are motivated to continue learning about different types of matrices and the important concepts associated with them."
