    "In various ways, you are likely to be familiar with the concept of **projection**. You may have encountered it in geography classes, through work related to graphics, or perhaps even in therapy sessions. It might also appear in philosophy readings or science-fiction movies. Usually, this term is associated with transferring certain properties of one object to another or carrying an image between two different spaces.\n",
