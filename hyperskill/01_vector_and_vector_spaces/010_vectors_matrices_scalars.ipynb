    "## The Idea of a Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often, a vector is characterized as an **ordered set of elements of the same type**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors in Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers use vectors to describe specific objects. In this context, the elements of a vector represent characteristics of the object being described.\n",
    "For example, a person can be represented by vectors such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(\\text{height}, \\text{weight})$\n",
    "- $(\\text{eye color}, \\text{hair color})$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, a vector is simply a structured way to store related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors in Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, vectors are used to describe various physical phenomena. These vectors are conveniently represented as **directed line segments**, which have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Magnitude** (length)\n",
    "- **Direction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation allows vectors to be visualized as arrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this interpretation, vectors can describe many physical quantities, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Velocity\n",
    "- Acceleration\n",
    "- Force\n",
    "- Electric fields\n",
    "- Magnetic fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Because arrows have direction, they help us visualize how a physical quantity acts in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weight** $(\\vec{W})$ is a force exerted by the gravitational pull of the Earth on an object.\n",
    "  It always points *downward*, in the direction that falling objects move.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial velocity** $(\\vec{v}_0)$ of a projectile describes how fast and in which direction the object is moving at the beginning of the observation, at time $t = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show how vectors naturally model real-world quantities that involve both size and direction."
