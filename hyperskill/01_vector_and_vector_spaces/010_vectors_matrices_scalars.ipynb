    "Mathematicians like to generalize. Therefore, if you ask a mathematician what a vector is, the answer will be that a vector is an element of a vector space. This means that vectors can be added together and multiplied by a scalar (for example, scalars could be real or complex numbers); both of these operations output another vector. The simplest case of a vector space is a set of lists of the same length $n$, consisting of real numbers, which are called components. The number of components (i.e. $n$) is called the dimension of the vector space.\n",
