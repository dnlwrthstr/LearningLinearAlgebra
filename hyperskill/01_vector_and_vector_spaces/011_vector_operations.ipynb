    "## Geometric interpretation of operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the **geometric meaning** behind basic vector operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector addition\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, the sum of two vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ is itself a vector.\n",
    "Geometrically, vector addition can be visualized using two equivalent rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triangle (head-to-tail) law\n",
    "\n",
    "The **triangle law** is used when the **head of the first vector** $\\vec{a}$ is placed at the **tail of the second vector** $\\vec{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Place the tail of $\\vec{b}$ at the head of $\\vec{a}$\n",
    "- The resulting vector $\\vec{a} + \\vec{b}$ goes from the tail of $\\vec{a}$ to the head of $\\vec{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is also called the **head-to-tail rule** and is often the easiest to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallelogram law\n",
    "\n",
    "The **parallelogram law** is used when both vectors share the **same tail**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Draw $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ starting from the same point\n",
    "- Complete a parallelogram by drawing lines parallel to each vector\n",
    "- The diagonal of the parallelogram starting at the common tail represents\n",
    "  the vector $\\vec{a} + \\vec{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both constructions give the **same resulting vector**, confirming that vector addition is independent of how vectors are placed, as long as their direction and magnitude are preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiplication by a scalar\n",
    "\n",
    "When a vector $\\vec{a}$ is multiplied by a scalar $\\lambda$, the result is a new vector $\\lambda \\vec{a}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $\\lambda > 0$, the vector keeps the **same direction** as $\\vec{a}$\n",
    "- If $\\lambda < 0$, the vector points in the **opposite direction**\n",
    "- The **length** of the vector is scaled by a factor of $|\\lambda|$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{a} = (2,\\,1).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying by $2$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2\\vec{a} = (4,\\,2),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which doubles the length of the vector while keeping its direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying by $-\\tfrac{1}{2}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\vec{a} = (-1,\\,-\\tfrac{1}{2}),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which reverses the direction of $\\vec{a}$ and scales its length by a factor of $\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometric takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector addition** corresponds to chaining movements in space\n",
    "- **Scalar multiplication** stretches, shrinks, or reverses vectors\n",
    "- These geometric interpretations are foundational for physics, computer graphics, machine learning, and game development"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Associativity of Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "This property is related to the order of parentheses. The main idea is that during the addition of more than two vectors, it is not important how the parentheses are arranged:\n",

When you add $\\vec c$ to $\\vec b$ using the triangle law, you obtain the yellow vector $\\vec b + \\vec c$. After that, apply the triangle law once more to add this vector to $\\vec a$, which gives the black vector\n",
