    "## Introduction: Linear Dependence\n",
    "\n",
    "You are already familiar with vectors and the key role they play in linear algebra and many other fields. A **vector** is an object that has both **magnitude** and **direction**. Vectors are useful for describing quantities such as velocity, force, or displacement—for example, the velocity of a vehicle in a video game.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, vectors are rarely studied in isolation. In most applications, we are interested in how vectors **relate to one another** and how they **interact**. For instance, we may want to model whether the velocity of the wind affects the velocity of a car, or whether one physical quantity can be expressed in terms of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the concept of **linear dependence** becomes essential. Linear dependence allows us to determine whether one vector can be expressed as a combination of others, helping us understand relationships between vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of linear dependence is a **fundamental concept** in linear algebra and plays a central role in mathematics, physics, engineering, computer graphics, data analysis, and machine learning."

    "## What Is Linear Dependence?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try to understand the concept of **linear dependence** through an analogy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you enjoy painting and want to buy some paints. Since you have a limited budget, you want to choose your colors wisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it make sense to buy **red**, **yellow**, and **orange** paint? Not really—because **orange can be obtained by mixing red and yellow**, buying orange is redundant. On the other hand, if you buy **red**, **yellow**, and **blue**, none of these colors can be created by mixing the others. In this case, each color contributes something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Red, yellow, and orange** form a **dependent** set of colors.\n",
    "- **Red, yellow, and blue** form an **independent** set of colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Colors to Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea transfers directly to vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of vectors is called **linearly dependent** if **at least one vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others**. Such a vector is redundant—it does not add any new information, because it can be constructed from the remaining vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, a set of vectors is **linearly independent** if **no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others**. Each vector contributes a new “direction” or degree of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will formalize these ideas using **linear combinations** and provide precise mathematical definitions of **linear dependence** and **linear independence**."
