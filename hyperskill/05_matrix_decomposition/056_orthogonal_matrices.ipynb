    "Bases are fundamental because they reconstruct the entire space using the minimum necessary information. **Orthonormal bases** are even more powerful: their vectors point in mutually orthogonal directions and have unit length, which allows any vector to be described using simple **dot products** with the basis vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since invertible matrices—whose columns form a basis—are already very useful and easy to handle, it is natural to expect that matrices whose columns form an **orthonormal basis** enjoy even better properties. These special matrices are known as **orthogonal matrices**.\n",

    "- When vectors are transformed using a general invertible matrix, it is often difficult to understand how their lengths and angles change. In contrast, an orthogonal matrix preserves both **lengths** and **angles**, so the transformed vectors retain the same geometric relationships as the original ones.\n",

    "- The geometric behavior of a generic invertible matrix can be complex and unintuitive. Orthogonal matrices, however, always produce **rigid transformations** of space, such as rotations and reflections.\n",

    "### Why orthogonal matrices matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of their simple, stable, and fully controlled behavior, orthogonal matrices are among the easiest non-trivial matrices to manipulate. This makes them fundamental building blocks in many important **matrix decompositions**, which express complicated matrices as products of simpler ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most significant decompositions involving orthogonal matrices include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spectral decomposition**\n",
    "- **Polar decomposition**\n",
    "\n",
    "These decompositions can be used, for example, to compute matrix square roots or to simplify equations describing conic sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the most important and widely used decomposition is the **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. In SVD, orthogonal matrices play a central and indispensable role, making them essential tools across mathematics, physics, data science, and machine learning.\n"
