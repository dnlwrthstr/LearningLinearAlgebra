    "\n",
    "Let us begin with the definition. Consider a **symmetric matrix** $A$ of size $n$. It is called:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positive definite (PD)** if all of its eigenvalues are **strictly positive**\n",
    "- **Positive semidefinite (PSD)** if all of its eigenvalues are **non-negative**\n",

    "1 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "-1 & 1\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues of the first matrix are $4$ and $2$, so it is **positive definite**.\n",
    "The eigenvalues of the second matrix are $2$ and $0$, hence it is **positive semidefinite**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the set of symmetric matrices may seem rather small, it contains an even more special family of matrices with remarkable additional properties. But if this set is so restricted, why should we care about it? After all, symmetric matrices do not appear frequently at first glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not worry—by the end of this topic, you will discover that **any matrix** (not necessarily square) can be used to construct a **PSD matrix**. Moreover, the properties of this PSD matrix allow you to analyze the original matrix in a powerful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since PD (PSD) matrices have **positive (non-negative) eigenvalues**, they behave in many ways like **positive (non-negative) numbers**. This analogy will naturally emerge when studying their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, note that because PD and PSD matrices are symmetric, they admit a **spectral decomposition**:\n",

    "$\n",
    "A = U D U^{T}\n",
    "$\n",

    "- $U$ is an **orthogonal matrix**\n",
    "- $D$ is a **diagonal matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting, the decomposition is especially meaningful because the diagonal entries of $D$ (the eigenvalues of $A$) are **positive** (or **non-negative**).\n",
