    "2x + 3y + z &= 8 \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional approach involves applying elementary row operations followed by back-substitution. While effective, this process can become cumbersome and computationally expensive for large systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LU-Decomposition** streamlines this procedure by breaking the problem into two simpler and more structured steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, LU-Decomposition is a method for factorizing a square matrix $A$ into the product of two matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = LU\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $L$ is a **lower triangular matrix** (entries above the main diagonal are zero),\n",
    "- $U$ is an **upper triangular matrix** (entries below the main diagonal are zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "This factorization transforms the original system\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Ax = b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "into two easier systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $Ly = b$  (forward substitution),\n",
    "2. $Ux = y$  (back substitution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step is computationally efficient and numerically stable compared to solving the original system directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LU-Decomposition Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- It reduces computational complexity when solving multiple systems with the same coefficient matrix but different right-hand sides.\n",
    "- It forms the basis of many numerical algorithms used in scientific computing.\n",
    "- It provides a clean structural interpretation of Gaussian elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Setup\n",
    "\n",

    "## Step 1: Gaussian Elimination for $U$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the LU-Decomposition process, constructing the upper triangular matrix $U$ is the first step. This step relies on **Gaussian Elimination**, which you have already encountered, but here we emphasize its role within LU-Decomposition.\n",

    "### Goal of This Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a square matrix $A$, the objective is to transform it into an **upper triangular matrix** $U$, where all entries below the main diagonal are zero:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation is achieved using elementary row operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Elimination Revisited\n",
    "\n",

    "### Why the Multipliers Matter\n",
