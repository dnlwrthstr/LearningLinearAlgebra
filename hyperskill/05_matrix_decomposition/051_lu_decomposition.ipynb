    "### Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, LU-Decomposition is a method for factorizing a square matrix $A$ into the product of two matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = LU\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $L$ is a **lower triangular matrix** (entries above the main diagonal are zero),\n",
    "- $U$ is an **upper triangular matrix** (entries below the main diagonal are zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "This factorization transforms the original system\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Ax = b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "into two easier systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $Ly = b$  (forward substitution),\n",
    "2. $Ux = y$  (back substitution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step is computationally efficient and numerically stable compared to solving the original system directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LU-Decomposition Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- It reduces computational complexity when solving multiple systems with the same coefficient matrix but different right-hand sides.\n",
    "- It forms the basis of many numerical algorithms used in scientific computing.\n",
    "- It provides a clean structural interpretation of Gaussian elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Setup\n",
    "\n",
