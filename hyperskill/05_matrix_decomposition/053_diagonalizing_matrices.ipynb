    "## How to Detect Diagonalizability\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every matrix is diagonalizable. However, the deep connection between diagonalizability and **eigenvectors** allows us to precisely characterize when a matrix can be diagonalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that each eigenvalue of a matrix has an associated **eigenspace**, defined as the subspace spanned by its eigenvectors. The **dimension** of this eigenspace is called the **geometric multiplicity** of the eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characterization Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "For an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, the following statements are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** $A$ is diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** There exists a basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (or $\\mathbb{C}^n$) consisting entirely of eigenvectors of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** The sum of the geometric multiplicities of all eigenvalues of $A$ is equal to $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest situation in which diagonalizability is guaranteed is when an $n \\times n$ matrix has **$n$ distinct eigenvalues**. In this case, the corresponding eigenvectors are automatically linearly independent, and $A$ is diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a matrix does **not** have $n$ distinct eigenvalues, diagonalizability is still possible, but it must be verified explicitly. In this case, one must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute all eigenvalues of $A$.\n",
    "2. Determine the geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue.\n",
    "3. Check whether the sum of these geometric multiplicities is equal to $n$.\n",

    "   - If the sum is exactly $n$, then $A$ is diagonalizable and you may proceed.\n",
    "   - If the sum is less than $n$, then $A$ is **not** diagonalizable.\n",

    "   - The columns of $P$ are the eigenvectors of $A$.\n",
