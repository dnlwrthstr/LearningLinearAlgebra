    "\n",
    "Even though the **union** of two subspaces usually fails to be a subspace (it is not stable under addition), it is still natural to ask how to combine two subspaces in a way that produces a **larger subspace** containing both of them.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Definition: Sum of Subspaces\n",

    "> The sum of two subspaces is itself a subspace.\n",

    "## Decomposing a Subspace Using a Basis\n",

    "The sum operation also helps us **break down** subspaces into simpler pieces.\n",

    "## Direct Sums\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that **linear dependence** introduces redundancy: one vector can be written as a combination of others. This is why we prefer **linearly independent** vectors.\n",
    "A very similar phenomenon occurs when **adding subspaces**: sometimes the information they contain overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two planes in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Even though every vector in space can be written as a sum of a vector from each plane, the representation is not unique because the planes intersect in a line. This overlap is precisely the redundancy we want to avoid.\n",
