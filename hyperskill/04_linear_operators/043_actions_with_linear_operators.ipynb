    "Vectors may be abstract objects, but so far you have been able to work with them fluently and obtain many useful results thanks to their structure. Operations such as **vector addition** and **scalar multiplication** provide all the flexibility you need.

Whether you are adding vectors in the plane or adding matrices, the underlying algebraic behavior is the same, and the results follow similar rules.\n",
