    "With one vector, we generate a line, while with two vectors (that do not belong to the same line), we obtain a plane. The next step seems quite natural, does it not? In $\\mathbb{R}^n$, we can take $k$ mutually different vectors (that are not $0$)\n",

    "\n",
    "When $k = 1$, this is simply a line, and when $k = 2$, it is a plane. Following the same reasoning as in the previous section, you can directly verify that this set is a vector subspace: when you add two linear combinations, you obtain another linear combination (the new coefficients are the sums of the original ones), and the same happens when you multiply any of them by a scalar (the new coefficients are the original ones multiplied by that scalar).\n",

    "Now, when we have three vectors that are not contained in the same plane, we obtain a three-dimensional space. Even though we may not be able to draw them, the same idea applies for four, five, or more vectors. However, whenever we take a new vector, we must ensure that it is not already contained in the space generated by the others.\n",

    "Now that we know what a subspace is, it is natural to ask why we should care about them. From everything we have done so far, we have discovered a key point: subspaces can be fully described using just a few elements. This is very useful, but it is not the only valuable aspect of subspaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a fundamental space, but in linear algebra we often deal with more complicated spaces. Examples include functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. This is a huge set, yet we can identify quite simple subspaces within it: polynomial, integrable, continuous, and differentiable functions are some notable examples. If you know a little calculus, you can easily verify this. Knowing certain subspaces can help us better understand the structure of the entire space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, systems of linear equations are one of the most important applications—practically the reason for the subject’s existence. Among them are homogeneous systems, and a crucial result is that their solutions form a subspace. Think about this for a moment: if this subspace were a plane, then all solutions could be described using only two vectors. An important observation is that although non-homogeneous systems are much more common and realistic, we can often reduce them to homogeneous systems and then apply the results we already know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a space is so complicated that we cannot easily manipulate its elements, unlike points in the plane. However, there are situations in which we understand one of its subspaces well and can use its elements to approximate those of the entire space as closely as possible. This idea is one of the deepest and most widely used concepts in linear algebra and is called **orthogonal projection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an arbitrary function that is very difficult to handle. Polynomial functions, on the other hand, are well understood. A classic technique is to find the polynomial that is closest to the function of interest. Although the original function may be very complicated, the polynomial approximation is often very similar while being much easier to work with and compute.\n"
