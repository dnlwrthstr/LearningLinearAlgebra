    "Systems of linear equations arise in virtually every scientific and engineering discipline—mathematics, physics, chemistry, economics, and many others. While there are multiple techniques for solving such systems, the **most general and systematic approach** is based on matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the matrix-based approach, a system of linear equations is first rewritten in **matrix form**. The core idea is then to simplify this matrix using **elementary row operations** until it reaches a structured form that makes the solutions easy to read off.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Apply elementary row operations**\n",
    "   These operations preserve the solution set of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reduce the matrix to echelon form**\n",
    "   The matrix takes on a staircase-like structure.\n",
