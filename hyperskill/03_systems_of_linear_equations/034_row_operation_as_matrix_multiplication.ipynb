    "In the **Row operations** chapter, we learned about the main operations on rows of a matrix: **row swapping**, **multiplication by a scalar**, and **row addition**. These operations naturally arise from the manipulations used to solve systems of linear equations. In practice, when we needed to perform one of these operations, we simply did it, which is effective but not particularly systematic from a mathematical point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, **all elementary row operations can be represented as matrix multiplication**. This means that each row operation corresponds to multiplying the original matrix by a specially constructed matrix. For example, if we want to swap two rows of a matrix, we can multiply it by a specific matrix that performs exactly this swap. The result is the same matrix, but with the chosen rows interchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation leads to a more structured and algebraic approach: instead of thinking of row operations as ad-hoc manipulations, we interpret them as **left multiplication by special matrices**, called **elementary matrices**.\n",
