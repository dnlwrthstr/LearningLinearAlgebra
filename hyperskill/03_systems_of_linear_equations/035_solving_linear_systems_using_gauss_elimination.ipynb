    "## Gaussian Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, you studied a method that reduces a matrix to an echelon matrix using elementary row operations. The method you are going to see now is called **Gaussian elimination**. After constructing an **augmented matrix**, we reduce it to an echelon matrix and then solve the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian elimination consists of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Construct the augmented matrix** by writing down the coefficients of the equations in a grid and adding an extra column on the right for the constant terms. Each row represents one equation.\n",
    "2. **Reduce the augmented matrix to an echelon form** using elementary row operations. Optionally, you may continue to the reduced row echelon form to simplify calculations.\n",
    "3. **Back-solving**, where you reconstruct the system of equations from the reduced matrix and find the values of the unknowns.\n",

    "## Linear System of Equations: Possible Outcomes After Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "After reducing an augmented matrix to **row echelon form** (or reduced row echelon form), several different situations may occur. Each of them corresponds to a different type of solution set for the system of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Unique Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "If, after reduction, the coefficient part of the augmented matrix is **triangular** (that is, each row introduces a new pivot), then the system has a **single unique solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left(\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n",
    "1 & 2 & -1 & 9 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 1 & 4\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each variable corresponds to a pivot position, so the solution is uniquely determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Infinitely Many Solutions**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the last row has more than one non-zero element, then the system has an infinite number of solutions. Like in the matrix below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "3 & 2 & 6 & 4 \\mid 4 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 7 & 1 \\mid 2 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 4 & 2 \\mid 9\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Redundant Equations (Still Infinitely Many Solutions)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If one or more rows consist entirely of zeros **both on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side**, then these rows represent **redundant equations**. They do not impose any new constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left(\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n",
    "3 & 2 & 6 & 4 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 7 & 2 \\\\\n",

    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such zero rows can be ignored, and the number of solutions is determined by the remaining rows. This typically leads to **infinitely many solutions** if there are free variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **No Solution (Inconsistent System)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a row appears where **all coefficients on the left-hand side are zero**, but the **right-hand side is non-zero**, then the system is **inconsistent** and has **no solutions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left(\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n",
    "3 & 2 & 6 & 4 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 7 & 2 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 4 & 9 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 & 8\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last row corresponds to the impossible equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "0 = 8\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which cannot be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Homogeneous Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "A system of linear equations is called **homogeneous** if **all constant terms are zero**, i.e.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Homogeneous systems **always have at least one solution**, called the **trivial solution**:\n",

    "Depending on the number of pivots, homogeneous systems may have:\n",
    "- only the trivial solution, or\n",
    "- infinitely many non-trivial solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Triangular matrix with pivots in every column** → unique solution\n",
    "- **Fewer pivots than variables** → infinitely many solutions\n",
    "- **Row of zeros equals zero** → redundant equation\n",
