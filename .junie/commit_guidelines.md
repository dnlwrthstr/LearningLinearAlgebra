# Commit Guidelines

To maintain a clean and efficient repository, please follow these steps before committing and pushing your changes:

1.  **Clear Notebook Outputs**: 
    Always clear the outputs of your Jupyter notebooks before committing. This reduces file size and prevents unnecessary diffs in version control.
    - In Jupyter: `Kernel` -> `Restart & Clear Output`
    - Or use a script to automate this.

2.  **Remove Empty Cells**: 
    Delete any trailing or intermediate empty cells in your notebooks to keep them concise and readable.

3.  **Update README.md**: 
    If your changes introduce new topics, notebooks, or dependencies, ensure the `README.md` is updated accordingly to reflect the current state of the project.

4.  **Verify Code & Tests**: 
    If applicable, ensure that any scripts or code snippets in the notebooks are functioning as expected.

5.  **Commit and Push**:
    Once the above steps are completed, stage your changes, commit with a descriptive message, and push to the remote repository.
